		You try to block the final strike, but your body is too slow.<br>
		You're vaguely aware of it all, your hands rising an instant too late to stop the claws coming towards you,<br>
		as though you were swimming through a thick molasses.<br><br>
		
		As you fall to the ground, you try to speak, but no words come out.<br>
		You're vaguely aware that you lost something important, but you can't seem to place what.<br><br>
		
		As your vision blurs, the Lady with Red Nails raising her claws a final time above you, you recall the gallery.<br>
		Your parents were having such a wonderful time.  Your father took too many pamphlets - it was a little obnoxious -<br>
		but he always does that.<br><br>
		
		You wonder if they're okay right now.  You didn't see anybody else in the dark gallery.  Maybe you were the only one.<br>
		They're probably wondering where you are.  Maybe they're already walking the gallery, calling for you.<br>
		You know, somehow, that they won't be able to find you, even your body.  At least they're safe.<br>
		You want to go home, you decide.  Your mother was going to cook pasta alfredo.<br>
		You'd like to taste something like that, one last time.  She always burns the sauce, but that's okay.<br>
		You wonder if they'll miss you.<br><br>
		
		As those blood-red claws strike again, you feel the last of your strength fading.<br>
		It's a sad thing, you think, tears coming to empty eyes,   that<br><br>
