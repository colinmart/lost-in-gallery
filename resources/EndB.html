		The stairs never end.<br><br>
		
		No matter how long you walk, you never seem to make any progress; only an endless diving spiral into an infinite black.<br><br>
		
		But just as you feel like your legs are about to give out, you realize you can see it, just barely.  The bottom of the chasm.<br>
		There's nothing there but a doorway.  Readying your blade, you take a deep breath and walk around the corner.<br><br>
		
		It's another gallery.<br><br>
		
		Its somber blue-lacquered rooms stretch out without revealing any destination, artificial roses sprouting from cracks in the walls.<br>
		It's decorated with paintings and sculptures you've never seen before, host to strange back-rooms and twisting corridors<br>
		that defy conventional physics.<br>
		You can see something moving, deep within.<br><br>
		
		But without a moment of hesitation, you find yourself crossing the threshold, still grinning gently.<br>
		Your hand tightens around your palette knife, red paint steadily dripping from its tip.<br><br>
		
		If any more monsters come for you, within this fathomless abyss...<br>
