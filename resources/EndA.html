	<p>
		The stairs never end.<br><br>
		
		You run until your legs give out, buckling over and falling hard onto cold stone.<br><br>
		
		Wiping blood from your eyes, a gentle ringing in your head slowly fading away, you realize you can't hear anybody coming after you.<br>
		And that if you look hard enough, you can see the bottom of the spiral staircase.<br><br>
		
		There's nothing there but a doorway.  Hurrying to the final step, you take a deep breath and peek around the corner.<br><br>
		
		It's another gallery.<br><br>
		
		Its somber blue-lacquered rooms stretch out without revealing any destination, artificial roses sprouting from cracks in the walls.<br>
		It's decorated with paintings and sculptures you've never seen before, host to strange back-rooms and twisting corridors<br>
		that defy conventional physics.<br>
		You can see something moving, deep within.<br><br>
		
		But with only a moment's hesitation, you find yourself crossing the threshold, a sheer determination driving your body forwards.<br><br>
		
		There's no way out but through.<br><br>
